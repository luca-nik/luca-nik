  <summary> 🧗🏼 My Mountaineering Adventures</summary>
  <br><br>
  Ok all this was quite boring..
  <br>
  Outside of my professional life, I am a passionate alpinist with more than 60 alpine climbs on record. 
  <br>
  The mountains help me put life's problems into perspective :)

Below are some photos I like from my climbs:
