# Hi 👋

I'm Luca.

I'm a Physics Engineer and PhD candidate in Theoretical & Computational Chemistry.

Previously MEV Scientist Engineer in the Team Agents at [Urani](https://github.com/urani-trade).

Currently looking for a role as Web3 developer 🚀.

## Something about me 

I'm curious 🙂.

I've been in academia for quite some time, from early experiments frying molecules with ultrafast lasers to getting hyped seeing hundreds of CPUs grinding Quantum Mechanical simulations. 

Blockchain technology hooked me, and now I want to build! 

## My interests 🎯

Network theory is a blast! I'm very interested in Web3 applications that can be formalized with it.

Routing algorithms for optimal trade execution and intents matching for users' MEV protection are just some of the areas I'm currently working on.

  <summary> 🧗🏼 My Mountaineering Adventures</summary>
  <br><br>
  Ok all this was quite boring..
  <br>
  Outside of my professional life, I am a passionate alpinist with more than 60 alpine climbs on record. 
  <br>
  The mountains help me put life's problems into perspective :)

Below are some photos I like from my climbs:
