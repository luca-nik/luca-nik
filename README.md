# Luca

Hi, I'm Luca, a Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Ph.D. candidate with a strong background in Physics and Engineering.

## üî¨ Research and Development

My research focuses on the theoretical development and practical application of multiscale atomistic models to simulate the physical properties of complex materials. 
This includes:

- Reactive and non-reactive Molecular Dynamics simulations using ReaxFF and Gromacs.
- Quantum chemistry methods for electronic structure calculations like DFT and CC.
- Development of multiscale QM/MM models.
- Optimization of numerical schemes for the solution of complex systems of equations.

## üõ† Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Advanced proficiency in Python.
- **Software Development:** Developer of scientific software for both commercial and research purposes
- **Code optimization and Parallelization:** Proficient in developing highly parallelized multi-thread and multi-process scientific codes.
- **Tools:** Experienced user of High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers

## üìö Education

- **Ph.D., Theoretical & Computational Chemistry** 
- **M.Sc. & B.Sc., Engineering Physics**, full marks.

## üó£Ô∏è Presentations and Publications

- **8** articles in peer-reviewed journals.
- **3** oral contributions at international scientific conferences.
- **1** Italian National and International patent pending.

## üéì Teaching

- Teaching assistant in the "Advanced Topics in Quantum Chemistry" course in 2023.

  <summary> üßóüèº My Mountaineering Adventures</summary>
  <br><br>
  Ok all this was quite boring..
  <br>
  Outside of my professional life, I am a passionate alpinist with more than 60 alpine climbs on record. 
  <br>
  The mountains help me put life's problems into perspective :)

Below are some photos I like from my climbs:
