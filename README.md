# Hi there 👋 

I'm Luca — a Research Scientist at [CryptoEconLab](https://cryptoeconlab.com/)

I hold a PhD in Theoretical & Computational Chemistry and a background in Engineering Physics.

Previously, I worked as an [MEV Scientist Engineer](https://www.urani.trade/blog/godspeed) with the Team Agents at [Urani.trade](https://github.com/urani-trade), building intent-based infrastructure for fairer and more efficient decentralized markets.

## About me 

I come from a scientific background: from early experiments frying molecules with ultrafast lasers to getting hyped seeing hundreds of CPUs grinding Quantum Mechanical simulations. 

After years in academia, I got hooked by the potential of blockchain technology.

At [Urani.trade](https://github.com/urani-trade), I explored routing algorithms for optimal trade execution and intent-based systems to protect users from toxic MEV — [here are a few things I wrote with Team Agents](https://www.urani.trade/blog).

You can read about some of my Web3 experiments and reflections on my [blog](https://naiky.vercel.app/web3).  
In my spare time, I'm [**diving into Large Language Model Agents**](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/llm-agents/f24).

## 🗣️ Presentations and Publications

- [**8** articles in peer-reviewed journals](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SsTwaqEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
- **3** oral contributions at international scientific conferences.

## 🎯 Achievements
