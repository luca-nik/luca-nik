# Hi 👋 

I'm Luca.

I'm a Physics Engineer and PhD in Theoretical & Computational Chemistry.

Previously [MEV Scientist Engineer](https://www.urani.trade/blog/godspeed) in the Team Agents at [Urani.trade](https://github.com/urani-trade).

## Something about me 

I'm curious 🙂.

I've been in academia for quite some time, from early experiments frying molecules with ultrafast lasers to getting hyped seeing hundreds of CPUs grinding Quantum Mechanical simulations. 

Blockchain technology hooked me, and now I want to build! 

## My interests

Network theory is a blast! I'm very interested in Web3 applications that can be formalized with it.

Routing algorithms for optimal trade execution and intents matching for users' MEV protection are just some of the areas I'm currently working on: [read some of the post I contributed in the Team Agents at Urani.trade](https://www.urani.trade/blog).

Read about some of my contributions to the Web3 ecosystem on my [Blog](https://naiky.vercel.app/web3).
